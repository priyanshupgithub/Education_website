        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking in distinguishing education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education. </p>

        <p class="sectiontag textbig">How education helps the society ?</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies. They determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children. </p>

        <p class="sectiontag textbig">Lets make the change in the education</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields. Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving certain goals, which include the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. However, there is extensive debate regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. Some theorists view education primarily as a process that occurs during educational events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.Others perceive it not as a process but as the product resulting from this process, emphasizing the mental states and dispositions of educated persons. </p>
